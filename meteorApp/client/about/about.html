		<h1>About Filmgrid</h1>
		<p>Filmgrid is an exciting new way to explore and discover movies. You can track which movies you have seen, what your favourite movies are, and what movies you want to watch. Based on this data, Filmgrid gives you personalised recommendations.</p>

		<p>Filmgrid is still under development. In the future, Filmgrid will be able to combine the data from you and your friends, to recommend movies all of you like and none of you have seen before. With real time updates and a beautiful user interface, a perfect film night has never been so easy.</p>
